                A Second Semester Junior at the University of Southern Indiana, majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Photograpy.
            </p>
            <p>
                While she originally went to University of Evansville, majoring in Electrical Engineering, she transfered to University of 
                Southern Indiana in the fall of 2021, taking the chance to also change her major after finding that she enjoyed the topic 
                much more while helping out with Girls Who Code and taking a required class at the University of Evansville.
            </p>
            <p>
                When transfering she found that most of her general education classes had been completed already so under advice decided to
                take the chance to round out her education somewhat by minoring in Photograpy which increased her creative skills.

                <strong>Girls Who Code</strong><br><hr>
                During her first semester at University of Evansville she was asked to volunteer to help teach a group of girls the basics
                of coding through a program called Girls Who Code.  During this time the group worked on Scratch to complete various simple
                projects including the one listed here: <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/445789622/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/445789622/</a>

            <strong>Toys for Tots</strong><br><hr>
            When she was younger, Elizabeth took the time to help her father at the local Toys for Tots group.  Her tasks involved
            organizing the donated toys into categories based on age and gender, and closer to the holiday time talking with the 
            parents to match the right toy to the right kid.

            At the University of Southern Indiana, Elizabeth took the time to join in an activity she enjoyed high school, the local 
            art club.  There she interacts with others involved in art and gets oppurtunities to showcase her work such as at the New
            Harmony Gallery in which the club put together a showcase of various types of works called "Hodge Podge", including four of
            her photos.
